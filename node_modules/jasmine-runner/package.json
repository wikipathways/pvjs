I like it but didn't like the gem too much so I decided to give a try at rolling my own tool written for node.js. Will publish to npm soon.\n\n## Installation instructions\nThis module is available for installation via npm. To install it simply type\n\tnpm install jasmine-runner\n\n## Usage\n\n### jasmine init\nWill create a new project structure in the current working directory with a few sample specs and source object\n\n### jasmine run\nStarts up the jasmine server to run specs from. Navigate to the url specified on the command line after running this command to manually run specs.\n\n### jasmine mon\nStarts the jasmine spec server up and monitors for file changes. Navigate to the url specified on the commandline to \"capture\" a browser. Now any file changes to specs or javascript files in the src_dir will make the browser automatically reload and rerun specs.\n\n### jasmine ci\nFires up the server, spawns a browser pointed to the test server, captures the resutls and shuts down. Ideal for CI systems.\n\n(This feature may be fuzzy until it gets reworked... the current implementation is inflexible)\n\n## Configuration\n{project dir}/spec/support/jasmine.json is a configuration file that can be used to configure the runner. Here are a break down of the fields that the runner pays attention to:\n\n### src_dir\nSpecifies where to load source files from\n\n### spec_dir\nSpecifies where to load specs from\n\n### externals\nAn array of miscelanious scripts to include, like jquery\n\n### sever\nconfiguration details for the server, such as port\n\n\n## Missing a Feature?\nLet me know! You can see my current backlog at https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/156137\n\n",
